# A note on the data

## Contents

The corpus consists of 1,489 essays written by 440 Swedish university students of English at three different levels, the majority in their first term of full-time studies. The total number of words is 1,221,265, which means an average essay length of 820 words. A typical first-term essay is somewhat shorter, averaging 777 words.

The essays cover set topics of different types. They were written out of class, against a deadline of two to three weeks, length limitations imposed (usually 700 – 800 words), and suitable text structure suggested. First-term students were admitted for both spring (January 20 – June 6) and autumn terms (September 1 – January 19).

First-term essays:

* a1. “English, my English.” Students describe their experience of the English language, evaluating their reading, writing, speaking, and listening proficiency. Personal, involved style. Written late January or early September.

* a2. Argumentation. Students argue for or against a statement concerning a topical issue. Formal style. Written in mid-February or early October.

* a3. Reflections. Students reflect on the medium of television and its impact on people, or on related issues of their choice. Personal/formal style. Written in March or October.

* a4. Literature course assignment. Students choose between a discussion of theme/character/narrator and a close-reading based analysis of a set passage. Formal style. Written in early April or November.

* a5. Culture course assignment. Students study topics in set secondary sources and compose an essay using this material, often quoting and listing these sources. Topics include issues such as 19th-century education of women, the industrial revolution, slavery, and utopias. Written in late April or November.

Second-term essays:

* b1. Causal analysis. Students discuss causes of some recent trend of their choice. Formal style. Suitable in content and style for comparison or combination with essay a3.

* b2. Argumentation. Students present counter-arguments to views expressed in articles or letters to the editor. Similar in approach and tone to essay a1.

* b3. Short papers in English linguistics, on various topics, e.g. loan words in English, English spelling, British and American English, the semantic properties of synonymous pairs. Academic style. Lengthy tables, lists of words, and appendices, irrelevant to the study of learner English, were removed (the place was marked in the document). Essays may still contain words in other languages than English, or from earlier periods of English, items quoted directly from dictionaries, and lists of references.

* b4. English literature. A discussion of character, theme etc., produced in a survey course, dealing with Shakespeare’s Julius Ceasar or contemporary novels. Essays may contain quotations, sometimes also references to secondary sources. Academic style.

* b5. American literature. Similar to b4. Essays formed part of a course on American contemporary novels and may contain quotations and references to secondary sources. Academic style.

In the autumn of 1999, 30 additional essays (coded b6—b8) were produced by second-term teacher trainees, namely

* b6. Taboo, not taboo. (12 essays)

* b7. Politics and education. (15 essays)

* b8. School visit reports. (3 essays)

Third-term essays:
