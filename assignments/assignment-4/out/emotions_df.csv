Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides for years and children are born and live and die all in darkness. That is the time for fear, my little Lord, when the White Walkers move through the woods. Thousands of years ago there came a night that lasted a generation. Kings froze to death in their castles, same as the shepherds in their huts. And women smothered their babies rather than see them starve, and wept and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks.

They never tell you how they all shit themselves. They don't put that part in the songs. Stupid boy. Now the Tarlys bend the knee like everyone else.

Season 2,"When I was twelve, my mother and father went to a wedding. Weddings in Volantis last for days, you know. And they left me with my little brother. The second afternoon they were gone was the hottest day in the three-year summer. We couldn't bear to be inside, so we ran down to the Rhoyne. Every child in Volantis was in the Rhoyne that day. The rich, the poor, we were all there. Naked, screaming, racing to the little islands. Drummers were playing for coppers on the east bank. I was treading water, talking to a friend, when I realized I hadn't seen my brother. I called his name. Then I started screaming his name. And then I saw him floating face down. My heart just stopped. I was I dragged him from the water. My friend helped me, I think. I don't even remember. He was so little. Then we pulled him onto the riverbank. And I screamed at him and I shook him. And he was dead. Just dead. A man ran over. He had a fish tattoo on his face. In Volantis, the slaves have tattoos. So you know what they are without having to talk to them. And this man worked on a fishing boat. And he pushed me out of the way. You have to understand, for a slave to push a highborn girl, that's death for the man, a terrible death. But he pushed me out of the way, and he started pressing on my brother's chest again and again and again, until my brother spat out half of the Rhoyne and cried out. And the man cradled his head and told him to be calm. I decided two things that day. I would not waste my years planning dances and masquerades with the other noble ladies. And when I came of age, I would never live in a slave city again. I'm sorry, Your Grace. You told me of your problems and I've blathered on.",disgust

He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet did nothing to dull my senses. With a hooked blade he sliced me, root and stem, chanting all the while. He burned my parts in a brazier. The flames turned blue and I heard a voice answer his call. I still dream of that night. Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade. I dream of the voice from the flames. Was it a god? A demon? A conjurer's trick? I don't know. But the sorcerer called and a voice answered. And ever since that day, I have hated magic and all those who practice it.

Step by step, one distasteful task after another, I made my way from the slums of Myr to the small council chamber. Influence grows like a weed.

Season 3,"The Mad King was obsessed with it. He loved to watch people burn, the way their skin blackened and blistered and melted off their bones. He burned lords he didn't like. He burned Hands who disobeyed him. He burned anyone who was against him. Before long, half the country was against him. Aerys saw traitors everywhere. So he had his pyromancer place caches of wildfire all over the city- beneath the Sept of Baelor and the slums of Flea Bottom. Under houses, stables, taverns. Even beneath the Red Keep itself. Finally, the day of reckoning came. Robert Baratheon marched on the capital after his victory at the Trident. But my father arrived first with the whole Lannister army at his back, promising to defend the city against the rebels. I knew my father better than that. He's never been one to pick the losing side. I told the Mad King as much. I urged him to surrender peacefully. But the king didn't listen to me. He didn't listen to Varys who tried to warn him. But he did listen to Grand Maester Pycelle, that grey, sunken cunt. 'You can trust the Lannisters,' he said. 'The Lannisters have always been true friends of the crown.' So we opened the gates and my father sacked the city. Once again, I came to the king, begging him to surrender. He told me to bring him my father's head. Then he turned to his pyromancer. 'Burn them all,' he said. 'Burn them in their homes. Burn them in their beds.' Tell me, if your precious Renly commanded you to kill your own father and stand by while thousands of men, women, and children burned alive, would you have done it? Would you have kept your oath then?",anger
Season 3,"First, I killed the pyromancer. And then when the king turned to flee, I drove my sword into his back. 'Burn them all,' he kept saying. 'Burn them all.' I don't think he expected to die. He- he meant to burn with the rest of us and rise again, reborn as a dragon to turn his enemies to ash. I slit his throat to make sure that didn't happen. That's where Ned Stark found me.",anger
Season 3,If this is true why didn't you tell anyone? Why didn't you tell Lord Stark?,anger

Season 3,We both know who would pay the most. Or make you pay the most if he found out you had captured me and sent me back up north for a summary execution.,neutral

Season 3,Perhaps Highgarden has a high tolerance for unnatural behavior.,disgust
Season 3,"I wouldn't say that. True, we don't tie ourselves in knots over a discreet bit of buggery, but brothers and sisters- where I come from, that stain would be very difficult to wash out.",neutral
Season 3,I will not breathe further life into a malicious lie by discussing it.,anger
Season 3,"Lie or not, you must admit many people find it quite convincing. Convincing enough to put swords in their hands and send them off to kill Lannisters and Tyrells thanks to our new affiliation.",neutral

Season 3,"I do admit it. If it weren't for your trick with the wildfire, Stannis would have sacked the city before Father got here. Our heads would still be rotting on the city gate.",disgust
Season 3,Trying to have me killed is an odd way of saying thank you. There are two people in King's Landing who can give an order to a Kingsguard. Did you or did you not order Ser Mandon to kill me during the Battle of the Blackwater?,neutral
Season 3,"The impulse I understand. He hates me because I'm the only one who tells him what he really is. So, fair enough. He wants me dead. But his stupidity? He could have had me poisoned and no one would have known. But the king orders a Kingsguard to murder the Hand of the King in full view of his own army. The boy's an idiot.",anger

Season 3,I don't think they will even notice it.,surprise
Season 3,"You're right. It's not my wedding. Anyway, from what I can tell, the dressmakers in Highgarden will be far superior to the ones in King's Landing. They'd never make me anything as dull as this for my wedding. Loras likes green and gold brocade.",sadness

Season 3,"You're so right. For instance, when I thwarted your plan to give Sansa Stark to the Tyrells. If I'm going to be honest, I did feel an unmistakable sense of enjoyment there. But your confidant, the one who fed you information about my plans, the one you swore to protect, you didn't bring her any enjoyment. And she didn't bring me any enjoyment. She was a bad investment on my part. Luckily, I have a friend who wanted to try something new. Something daring. And he was so grateful to me for providing this fresh experience.",joy
Season 3,I did what I did for the good of the realm.,anger

Season 4,Justice.,neutral
Season 4,Yeah. A good king must be just. Orys I was just. Everyone applauded his reforms. Nobles and commoners alike. But he wasn't just for long.

Season 4,"Yes. Strength. King Robert was strong. He won the rebellion and crushed the Targaryen dynasty. And he attended three small council meetings in 17 years. He spent his time whoring and hunting and drinking until the last two killed him.

How do you know which choice is wise and which isn't? You've any experience of treasuries and granaries or shipyards and soldiers?,neutral
Season 4,"No. Of course not. A wise king knows what he knows and what he doesn't. You're young. A wise young king listens to his counselors and heeds their advice until he comes of age. And the wisest kings continue to listen to them long afterwards... Your brother was not a wise king. Your brother was not a good king. If he had been, perhaps he'd still be alive. Now, as the king, you will have to marry. Do you understand why?",neutral

Season 4,Thanks. I do my best.,neutral
Season 4,"A good kidney pie is all about the ingredients. Flour, lard, water, eggs, milk. Easy enough. But the meat, peacetime or not, getting your hands on a good bottom round steak and calves' kidneys is not easy. I mean, some people settle for plain old beef kidneys. Got no right to cook anything, them. Oh, and the gravy. Don't get me started on the gravy. Very difficult to get right. See, a lot of people give up on the gravy. You cannot give up on the gravy. No gravy, no pie. Simple as that. That's nice armor. Are you a knight?",disgust

Season 4,My lady. My lord. Could I have a word?,surprise
Season 4,What about? Not kidney pie.,neutral

Season 4,So what happened to her?,surprise
Season 4,Well-,neutral
Season 4,The quick version.,neutral
Season 4,The Lannisters took us prisoner. We escaped. The Brotherhood took us prisoner. They sold me to the innkeep. They were gonna sell Arya to her mother at Riverrun along with another prisoner. Big ugly fellow. Foul mouth and a face like a half-burnt ham. Not friendly.,disgust

Season 4,Why the Eyrie?,surprise
Season 4,"Her aunt, Lysa Arryn. Catelyn Stark's sister. She's Arya's last living relative with money. She hates the Lannisters. Lord Tyrion made sure I knew which house married which and who hated who.",disgust

Season 4,"Aye, my lady. Could be.",neutral
Season 4,You sure about this?,surprise
Season 4,No.,neutral

Season 4,Your sister.,anger
Season 4,Oh.,neutral
Season 4,Cersei approached me. We spoke a great deal about her daughter. How worried your sister is about her. She was trying very hard to pretend she had not come to sway me against you. I think she may have even believed it herself.,neutral
Season 4,Making honest feelings do dishonest work is one of her many gifts.,disgust
Season 4,It was difficult for her to hide her true intentions. It is rare to meet a Lannister who shares my enthusiasm for dead Lannisters. She desperately wants to see you killed.,neutral
Season 4,She didn't need to bother you. It looks as though I've taken care of that myself. The joy she will feel when my head leaves my neck. She's wanted this for a long time.,joy
Season 4,"Yes, I know. We met, you and I. Many years ago.",neutral
Season 4,I think I would have remembered that.,surprise
Season 4,"Unlikely. You had just been born. Our father brought me and my sister Elia with him on a visit to Casterly Rock. My first time away from Dorne. I didn't like anything about the Rock. Not the food, not the weather, your accents. Nothing. But the biggest disappointment... you.",sadness
Season 4,You and my family have more in common than you might admit.,neutral
Season 4,"The whole way from Dorne all anyone talked about was the monster that had been born to Tywin Lannister. A head twice the size of his body, a tail between his legs, claws, one red eye, the privates of both a girl and a boy.",disgust
Season 4,That would have made things so much easier.,neutral
Season 4,"When we met your sister, she promised she would show you to us. Every day we would ask. Every day she would say, ""Soon."" Then she and your brother took us to your nursery and... she unveiled the freak. Your head was a bit large. Your arms and legs were a bit small, but no claw. No red eye. No tail between your legs. Just a tiny pink cock. We didn't try to hide our disappointment. ""That's not a monster,"" I told Cersei. ""That's just a baby."" And she said, ""He killed my mother."" And she pinched your little cock so hard, I thought she might pull it off. Until your brother made her stop. ""It doesn't matter,"" she told us. ""Everyone says he will die soon.

Season 4,"Yes, you certainly are.",neutral
Season 4,When will you go back?,neutral
Season 4,Probably never. My family doesn't live there anymore and someone burned it down.,anger
Season 4,Oh. Does Winterfell have a Moon Door?,neutral
Season 4,"No, I'm afraid not. It's not high up in the mountains. It's down on the ground.",fear
Season 4,That sounds dangerous. How do you make people fly?,fear
Season 4,We don't.,neutral
Season 4,What do you do with all the bad people and the scary people and the people you don't like?,fear
Season 4,I never did anything with them at all. Girls didn't take part in that where I came from.,disgust
Season 4,"Well, I'm Lord of the Vale. When I grow up, I'll be able to fly anybody who bothers me. Or you. When we get married, you can tell me if you don't like somebody and then we can bring them back here and, whoosh! Right through the Moon Door.",surprise

Season 4,No.,neutral
Season 4,"Neither do I, precisely. Hundreds of feet. It's fascinating what happens to bodies when they hit the rocks from such a height. The impact breaks them right apart.

They kept her alive, moving her from place to place, often hours ahead of the men who had been sent to kill her. She was eventually sold off to some warlord on the edge of the world and that appeared to be that.

Season 7,Forgive me --,anger
Season 7,"Your Grace, this is Ser Davos Seaworth.",neutral
Season 7,"Forgive me, Ser Davos. I never did receive a formal education, but I could have sworn the last King in the North was Torren Stark who bent the knee to my ancestor Aegon Targaryen in exchange for his life and the lives of the northmen. Torren Stark swore fealty to House Targaryen in perpetuity. But do I have my facts wrong?",anger
Season 7,"I wasn't there, Your Grace.",neutral

Season 7,I am not.,neutral
Season 7,"Oh. Well, that is unfortunate. You've travelled all this way to break faith with House Targaryen?",neutral
Season 7,Break faith? Your father burned my grandfather alive. He burned my uncle alive. He would have burned the Seven Kingdoms.,anger
Season 7,"My father was an evil man. On behalf of House Targaryen I ask your forgiveness for the crimes he committed against your family. And I ask you not to judge a daughter by the sins of her father. Our two houses were allies for centuries. Those were the best centuries the kingdom's ever known. Centuries of peace and prosperity with the Targaryens sitting on the Iron Throne and a Stark serving as Warden of the North. I am the last Targaryen, Jon Snow. Honor the pledge your ancestor made to mine. Bend the knee and I will name you Warden of the North. Together we will save this country from those who would destroy it.",anger
Season 7,You're right. You're not guilty of your father's crime. And I'm not beholden to my ancestor's vows.,neutral

Season 7,Almost.,neutral
Season 7,But you haven't stormed King's Landing. Why not? The only reason I can see is you don't want to kill thousands of innocent people. It's the fastest way to win the war but you won't do it. Which means at the very least you're better than Cersei.,neutral
Season 7,"Still, that doesn't explain why I need your help.",neutral
Season 7,"Because right now you and I and Cersei and everyone else, we're children playing at a game screaming that the rules aren't fair.",anger
Season 7,You told me you liked this man.,joy
Season 7,I do.,neutral
Season 7,"In the time since he's met me he's refused to call me queen, he's refused to bow and now he's calling me a child.",anger

Season 7,"We fled before Robert's assassins could find us. Robert was your father's best friend, no? I wonder if your father knew his best friend sent assassins to murder a baby girl in her crib. Not that it matters now of course. I spent my life in foreign lands. So many men have tried to kill me. I don't remember all of their names. I have been sold like a brood mare. I have been chained and betrayed, raped and defiled. Do you know what kept me standing through all those years in exile? Faith. Not in any gods. Not in myths and legends. In myself. In Daenerys Targaryen. The world hadn't seen a dragon in centuries until my children were born. The Dothraki hadn't crossed the sea. Any sea.",disgust
Season 7,They did for me. I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms. And I will.,neutral

Season 7,You don't believe him. I understand that. It sounds like nonsense.,anger
Season 7,"But if destiny has brough Daenerys Targaryen back to our shores, it has also made Jon Snow King in the North. You were the first to bring Dothraki to Westeros. He was the first to make allies with Wildlings and northmen. He was named Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. He was named King in the North. Not because of his birthright. He has no birthright. He's a damn bastard. All those hard son's of bitches chose him as their leader because they believe in him.",anger
Season 7,"All those things you don't believe in, he faced those things. He fought those things for the good of his people. He risked his life for his people. He took a knife in the heart for his people. He gave his own --",anger

Season 7,It takes no time to bend the knee. Pledge your sword to her cause.,neutral
Season 7,And why would I do that?,surprise
Season 7,"I mean no offense, Your Grace, but I don't know you. As far as I can tell your claim to the throne rests entirely on your father's name. And my own father fought to overthrow the Mad King. The lords of the north placed their trust in me to lead them. And I will continue to do so as well as I can.",anger
Season 7,"That's fair. It's also fair to point out that I'm the rightful queen of the Seven Kingdoms. By declaring yourself king of the northern most kingdom, you are in open rebellion.",anger
Season 7,You must forgive my manners. You will both be tired after your long journey. We'll have baths drawn for you and supper sent to your rooms.,neutral

Season 7,"Shhh, shhh, shhh, not now. We'll talk later.",fear

Season 7,"The sound of your scream. I never heard a sound like that. I thought, that's true love. Oberyn looked beautiful that day. He really did. No one moved like him. No one had such skill with a spear. Even Ser Gregor couldn't stop him. If only he hadn't taunted him. He could have walked away and left poor Ser Gregor to die. But that wasn't your lover's way, was it? Now he's burried somewhere. And here Ser Gregor is stronger than ever. That must be difficult for you. When my daughter was taken from me, my only daughter, well, you can't imagine how that feels unless you've lost a child. I fed her at my own breast even though they told me to give her to the wet nurse. I couldn't bear to see her in another woman's arms. I never got to have a mother. But Myrcella did. She was mine and you took her from me. Why did you do that?",disgust
Season 7,It doesn't matter now.,neutral
Season 7,"Your daughter is a beauty too. Brown eyes, those lips. A perfect Dornish beauty.",neutral

Season 7,"Do you feel powerful now? I don't sleep very well, not at all really. I lie in bed and I stare at the canopy and imagine ways of killing my enemies. How to destroy Ellaria Sand, the woman who murdered my only daughter. I thought about having Ser Gregor crush your skull the way he did Oberyn's. It would be poetic I suppose but fast. Too fast.",disgust

Season 7,The Iron Bank didn't send you hear to offer condolences.,sadness
Season 7,Condolences and congratulations. You've become the first ruling queen in the Seven Kingdoms. That's quite an accomplishment. The Iron Bank appreciates how you cast off the yoke of superstition freeing the crown from elements that sought to subvert the rule of law.,joy
Season 7,The destruction of the Sept of Baelor was a tragic accident.,sadness
Season 7,Indeed. But sometimes tragedies are necessary to restore order and rational leadership.,neutral
Season 7,The Iron Bank wants its gold back.,neutral
Season 7,"Your father never minced words either. But, yes, your debts are considerable. And you are now engaged in a conflict on several fronts. We both know how expensive war can be.",neutral
Season 7,And we both know gold wins wars. Your vaults are empty. Your late husbando s profligacy saw to that.,neutral
Season 7,Your wealthiest ally is the Tyrells who are now your enemies. You're surrounded on all sides by rivals for the throne.,disgust
Season 7,And the Iron Bank wants to bet on a winner.,neutral
Season 7,We don't make bets. We invest in endeavors we deem likely to be successful.,neutral
Season 7,That's a fancy way of saying bet. The war has already begun. I've drawn first blood. I decapitated the Dornish snake. My armada owns the Narrow Sea.,disgust
Season 7,Euron Greyjoy's armada owns the Narrow Sea.,neutral
Season 7,Euron Greyjoy is loyal to me.,neutral
Season 7,For now. Daenerys Targaryen has three full grown dragons. How well do wooden ships fare against fire breathing dragons?,neutral
Season 7,"Her dragons might not be as invulnerable as some think. Now, let's talk about the Targaryen girl. You want to invest in her? I'm guessing the Iron Bank invested considerable gold in the slave trade. How are you profits now that Daenerys has freed all the slaves?",neutral
Season 7,"The slave trade has entered a down turn, it's true.",neutral
Season 7,From what I gather she considers herself more of a revolutionary that a monarch. In your experience how do bankers usually fare with revoltionaries?,neutral
Season 7,The Lannisters owe the Iron Bank quite a lot of money but Lannisters always pay their debts. Do former slaves or Dothraki or dragons?,neutral
Season 7,Your father's daughter indeed.,disgust
Season 7,Give me a fortnight. Stay in King's Landing as my honored guest and when you return to Braavos I swear to you my debt will be paid in full.,neutral
Season 7,I came out here to brood over my failure to predict the Greyjoy attack. You're making it difficult. You look a lot better brooding than I do. You make me feel like I'm failing at brooding over failing.,disgust
Season 7,I'm a prisoner on this island.,fear

Season 7,It's hard for me to fathom. It really is. If someone told me about the White Walkers and the Night King --,surprise
Season 7,You probably don't believe me.,anger
Season 7,I do actually.,neutral
Season 7,You didn't before. Grumpkins and snarks you called them. Do you remember? You said it was all nonsense.,neutral
Season 7,"It was all nonsense. Everybody knew it. But then Mormont saw them and you saw them, and I trust the eyes of an honest man more than I trust what everybody knows.",neutral
Season 7,How do I convince people who don't know me that an enemey they don't believe in is coming to kill them all?,anger
Season 7,Good question.,neutral
Season 7,I know it's a good question. I'm looking for an answer.,joy
Season 7,"People's minds aren't made for problems that large. White Walkers, the Night King, Army of the Dead, it's almost a relief to confront a familiar monster like my sister.",neutral
Season 7,I need to help prepare my people for what's coming. I can't help them from here. I'd like to leave.,sadness
Season 7,It seems unlikely that you became King in the North by giving up that easily.,neutral
Season 7,"Everyone told me to learn from my father's mistakes. Don't go south. Don't answer a summons from the Mad King's daughter, a foreign invader. And here I am. A northern fool.",anger
Season 7,"Children are not their fathers, luckily for all of us. And sometimes there's more to foreign invaders than northern fools that meets the eye. Daenerys could have sailed for Westeros long ago but she didn't. Instead she stayed where she was and saved many people from horrible fates some of whom are on this island with us right now. While you're our guest here you might consider asking them what they think of the Mad King's daughter. She protects people from monsters, just as you do. That's why she came here. And she's not about to head north to fight an enemy she's never seen on a word of a man she doesn't know after a single meeting. That's not a reasonable thing to ask.",neutral
Season 7,So do you have anything reasonable to ask?,neutral
Season 7,What do you mean?,surprise
Season 7,Maybe you are a northern fool. I'm asking if there's something I can do to help you.,neutral
Season 7,Dragonglass?,surprise
Season 7,"Yes. Volcanic glass, obsidian. He says you have a tremendous amount of it here.",neutral
Season 7,Why are we talking about glass? We just lost two of our allies.,surprise
Season 7,"Which is why I was speaking to Jon Snow, a potential ally.",joy
Season 7,And what does the King in the North want with Dragonglass?,neutral
Season 7,"Apparently it can be turned into weapons that kill White Walkers and their foot soldiers, or stop them, destroy them. I'm unsure of the nomenclature.",fear
Season 7,And what do you think of this Army of the Dead and White Walkers and Night Kings?,neutral
Season 7,"I'd very much like to believe that Jon Snow is wrong, but a wise man once said that you should never believe a thing simply because you want to believe it.",neutral
Season 7,Which wise man said this?,neutral
Season 7,I don't remember.,neutral
Season 7,Are you trying to present your own statements as ancient wisdom?,disgust
Season 7,"I would never do that...to you. The reason I believe Jon Snow is because he's here. All of his advisors would have told him not to come. I would have told him not to come, yet he's here anyway. You don't have to believe him. Let him mine the Dragonglass. If he's wrong it's worthless. You didn't even know it was here. It's nothing to you. Give him something by giving him nothing. Take a step toward a more productive relationship with a possible ally. Keep him occupied while we focus on the task at hand. Casterly Rock.",anger
Season 7,What was that Ser Davos said about taking a knife in the heart for his people? Did you notice that?,surprise
Season 7,You must allow them their flights of fancy. It's dreary in the north.,sadness

Season 7,I named them for my brothers Vicerys and Rhaegon. They're both gone now.,neutral
Season 7,You lost two brothers as well?,sadness

Season 7,You know I'm not going to let Cersei stay on the Iron Throne.,neutral
Season 7,I never expected that you would.,surprise
Season 7,And I haven't changed my mind about which kingdoms belong to the throne.,neutral
Season 7,I haven't either.,neutral
Season 7,I will allow you to mine the Dragonglass and forge weapons from it. Any resources or men you need I will provide for you.,neutral

Season 7,"You better get to work, Jon Snow.",neutral
Season 7,How much do we have?,neutral
Season 7,"4,000 bushels, My Lady.",neutral
Season 7,What does that mean?,surprise
Season 7,"For the current occupants of the castle it's enough food for a year, perhaps more.",neutral
Season 7,What's the longest winter in the past 100 years?,neutral
Season 7,I'm not entirely certain. I'll check Maester Llewyn's records. He kept a copy of every raven scroll.,neutral
Season 7,"You're telling me we don't have enough food, especially not if the armies of the north come back to defend Winterfell.",neutral
Season 7,"No, My Lady, most likely not.",neutral
Season 7,"We must prepare for that eventuality. Every direction the threat comes from, this is the best place to be. We need to start building up our grain stores with regular shipments from every keep in the north. If we don't use it by winter's end we'll give it back to them, but if the entire north has to flee to Winterfell there won't be enough time to bring wagonloads of grain with them.",neutral

Season 7,"Don't fight in the north or the south. Fight every battle everywhere always in your mind.

Season 7,Hmm.,neutral
Season 7,Hmm. Does it hurt?,sadness
Season 7,A bit. Less than before.,neutral
Season 7,The infection no longer appears to be active.,neutral
Season 7,Unusual. Unlikely. One could almost be forgiven for thinking the entire upper layer of diseased skin was debrided and the underlying region treated with some sort of ointment.,neutral
Season 7,I don't know anything about that. I just started feeling better. I assumed it was the rest that did it.,neutral
Season 7,And the climate.,neutral

Season 7,I suppose I'll find out this evening.,neutral

Season 7,Who forbade you or anyone to attempt to treat him?,anger
Season 7,I seem to remember you.,surprise
Season 7,But you treated him anyway?,disgust
Season 7,I did.,neutral
Season 7,"I forbade it because it's dangerous and rarely successful. Especially on someone of that age. You could have infected yourself and others. You could have devastated the entire Citadel.

Season 7,"Thank you, Archmaester.",neutral
Season 7,Come here.,neutral
Season 7,All these manuscripts and scrolls and rotting away. I need you to make copies of them.,disgust

Season 7,Then why are we here?,surprise
Season 7,This isn't about living in harmony. It's just about living. The same thing is coming for all of us. A general you can't negotiate with.

Season 7,"Cersei, I didn't know.",surprise
Season 7,the destruction of this family.,anger
Season 7,I am the one preventing that from happening. Daenerys didn't want to debate and negotiate. She didn't want to bring you words. She wanted to bring you fire and blood until I advised her otherwise. I don't want to destroy our family. I never have.,anger
Season 7,You killed our father,anger
Season 7,"After he sentenced me to death for a crime I didn't commit, yes, I killed him. Hate me for it if you want. I hate myself for it in spite of what he was, in spite of what he did to me.",anger

Season 7,"That thing you dragged here, I know what it is, I know what it means. And when it came at me, I didn't think about the world. Not at all. As soon as it opened its mouth, the world disappeared for me, right down its black throat.
